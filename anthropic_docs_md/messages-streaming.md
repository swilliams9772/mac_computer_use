When creating a Message, you can set `"stream": true` to incrementally stream the response using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents) (SSE).

# [​](#streaming-with-sdks) Streaming with SDKs

Our [Python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript) SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

Python

TypeScript

```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
) as stream:
  for text in stream.text_stream:
      print(text, end="", flush=True)

```

# [​](#event-types) Event types

Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. `event: message_stop`), and include the matching event `type` in its data.

Each stream uses the following event flow:

1. `message_start`: contains a `Message` object with empty `content`.
2. A series of content blocks, each of which have a `content_block_start`, one or more `content_block_delta` events, and a `content_block_stop` event. Each content block will have an `index` that corresponds to its index in the final Message `content` array.
3. One or more `message_delta` events, indicating top-level changes to the final `Message` object.
4. A final `message_stop` event.

The token counts shown in the `usage` field of the `message_delta` event are *cumulative*.

# [​](#ping-events) Ping events

Event streams may also include any number of `ping` events.

# [​](#error-events) Error events

We may occasionally send [errors](/en/api/errors) in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an `overloaded_error`, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:

Example error

```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}

```

# [​](#other-events) Other events

In accordance with our [versioning policy](/en/api/versioning), we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.

# [​](#content-block-delta-types) Content block delta types

Each `content_block_delta` event contains a `delta` of a type that updates the `content` block at a given `index`.

# [​](#text-delta) Text delta

A `text` content block delta looks like:

Text delta

```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}

```

# [​](#input-json-delta) Input JSON delta

The deltas for `tool_use` content blocks correspond to updates for the `input` field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are *partial JSON strings*, whereas the final `tool_use.input` is always an *object*.

You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a `content_block_stop` event, by using a library like [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json/#partial-json-parsing) to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our [SDKs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/client-sdks), which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.

A `tool_use` content block delta looks like:

Input JSON delta

```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}

```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from `input` at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an `input` key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple `content_block_delta` events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.

# [​](#thinking-delta) Thinking delta

When using [extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#streaming-extended-thinking) with streaming enabled, you’ll receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events. These deltas correspond to the `thinking` field of the `thinking` content blocks.

For thinking content, a special `signature_delta` event is sent just before the `content_block_stop` event. This signature is used to verify the integrity of the thinking block.

A typical thinking delta looks like:

Thinking delta

```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "thinking_delta", "thinking": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First break down 27 * 453"}}

```

The signature delta looks like:

Signature delta

```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "signature_delta", "signature": "EqQBCgIYAhIM1gbcDa9GJwZA2b3hGgxBdjrkzLoky3dl1pkiMOYds..."}}

```

# [​](#full-http-stream-response) Full HTTP Stream response

We strongly recommend that use our [client SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks) when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.

A stream response is comprised of:

1. A `message_start` event
2. Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
   * A `content_block_start` event
   * Potentially multiple `content_block_delta` events
   * A `content_block_stop` event
3. A `message_delta` event
4. A `message_stop` event

There may be `ping` events dispersed throughout the response as well. See [Event types](/_sites/docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/streaming#event-types) for more details on the format.
