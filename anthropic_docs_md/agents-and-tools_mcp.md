MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

# [​](#mcp-connector) MCP connector

Connect to remote MCP servers directly from the Messages API without building an MCP client. This feature provides seamless integration with MCP-compatible tools and services.
