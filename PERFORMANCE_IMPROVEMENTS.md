# Performance Improvements for Agent Testing the Burial Allowance Application

## Overview
This document summarizes the key performance improvements implemented based on Anthropic's documentation and best practices for Claude 4, Claude 3.7, and computer use optimization.

## Major Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Tool Version & Beta Flag Optimization**
- **Enhanced model detection**: Improved `get_tool_versions_for_model()` to properly handle Bedrock cross-region inference profiles
- **Base model extraction**: Added logic to correctly parse model names like `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`
- **Tool version mapping**: 
  - Claude 4: Uses `text_editor_20250429` (latest version)
  - Claude 3.7: Uses `text_editor_20250124` for token efficiency
  - Claude 3.5: Uses `text_editor_20241022` (stable version)

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling & Timeout Management**
- **Specific HTTP status handling**: Added actionable error messages for:
  - 429 (Rate Limit): Includes retry-after header parsing and tier upgrade guidance
  - 413 (Request Too Large): Specific guidance on reducing tokens, images, history
  - 529 (API Overloaded): Exponential backoff recommendations
  - 400/401/403: Clear parameter and authentication guidance
- **Timeout improvements**: Enhanced timeout errors with thinking budget context
- **Batch processing recommendations**: Automatic suggestions for >32k thinking budgets

### 3. **System Prompt Enhancement with Claude 4 Best Practices**
- **Explicit instruction guidelines**: Added Claude 4's preference for clear, explicit instructions
- **Parallel tool execution guidance**: Enhanced prompting for near 100% parallel tool success rate
- **Step-by-step verification patterns**: Integrated "After each step, take a screenshot and carefully evaluate..." guidance
- **M4 MacBook Air optimizations**: Hardware-specific thermal and performance management
- **Sequoia form handling strategies**: Enhanced web form automation for macOS 15.6

#### Key Claude 4 Patterns Added:
```
"Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible"
"Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation"
"After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps"
```

### 4. **Computer Tool Screenshot Resolution Optimization**
- **Anthropic XGA/WXGA compliance**: Implemented resolution targeting of 1024x768 to 1280x800 range
- **Automatic resizing**: Added `sips` command integration for optimal Claude performance
- **Resolution debugging**: Added logging when resolution optimization is applied
- **Performance comments**: Enhanced coordinate scaling with optimization notes

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Beta Flag Management
```python
def get_beta_flags_for_model(model: str) -> list[str]:
    """Get all appropriate beta flags for a given model."""
    beta_flags = []
    
    # Add token efficiency for Claude 3.7 FIRST (most important for performance)
    if model_supports_token_efficiency(model):
        beta_flags.append("token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19")
    
    # Add interleaved thinking for Claude 4 FIRST (most important for performance)
    if model_supports_interleaved_thinking(model):
        beta_flags.append("interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14")
    
    # Get the primary tool beta flag LAST (required but less performance critical)
    tool_versions = get_tool_versions_for_model(model)
    beta_flags.append(tool_versions["beta_flag"])
    
    return beta_flags
```

### Screenshot Resolution Optimization
```python
def get_optimal_screenshot_resolution(self) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Get optimal screenshot resolution based on Anthropic recommendations."""
    # Target around 1024x768 to 1280x800 range for better model accuracy and speed
    max_width = 1280
    max_height = 1024
    
    # Calculate scale to fit within recommended bounds
    width_scale = max_width / self.width if self.width > max_width else 1.0
    height_scale = max_height / self.height if self.height > max_height else 1.0
    scale = min(width_scale, height_scale)
    
    optimal_width = int(self.width * scale)
    optimal_height = int(self.height * scale)
    
    return (optimal_width, optimal_height)
```
